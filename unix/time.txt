# vim: ft=sh :

# show date in seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC
date +%s

# show current timezone
date -R

# show hardware clock
hwclock --localtime

# Linux treate the hardware clock as UTC while Windows treate it as local time
# e.g.  set time to 11:12:13
date --set="11:12:13" # or simpler: date -s 11:12:13
# synchronize hardware clock to system clock
hwclock --systohc
# if you have a Windows installed in the same computer, the time on Windows
# will go wrong(8 hours earlier in Beijing, China),
# because Windows treat the CMOS time as local time, while Linux treat it as
# UTC.

# atime, ctime, mtime
# a save operation(e.g. :w in vi) will change mtime and ctime.
# even the content did NOT change
# use `mv' will only change ctime.
# mtime is a subset of ctime
# mtime: modify time
ls -l
# ctime: change time
ls -lc
# atime: access time
# read operation will change atime, write will not.
# e.g. date >> test.txt will NOT change atime(test.txt already exist)
ls -lu

# change timezone
export TZ='Asia/Shanghai'
# after this, the `date' command will show local time instead of UTC


# to get precise time, you need NTP:
# but ntpdate will not work as expected, while ntpd does
systemctl start ntpd # systemd way
