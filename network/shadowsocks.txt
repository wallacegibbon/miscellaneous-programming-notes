## vim: ft=markdown :

There are many versions of shadowsocks implementations, bug many of them just
did not work for some reason, the python version works.

Use pip to install `shadowsocks` and start it like this:
```sh
ssserver -c conf.json start

ssserver -c conf.json -d start #run as daemon
ssserver -c conf.json -d stop
```

The configuration json:
```json
{
    "server":"12.34.56.78",
    "server_port":8388,
    "local_address": "127.0.0.1",
    "local_port":1080,
    "password":"mypassword...",
    "timeout":300,
    "method":"aes-256-gcm"
}
```

the shadowsocks pakcege may be outdate (and do not support aes-256-gcm),
update it in this way
```sh
pip3 install https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/archive/master.zip -U
```
